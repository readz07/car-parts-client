        "description":"Instead, air is compressed and fed into a combustion chamber, into which fuel is sprayed. The fuel/air mixture is then ignited and the gases produced are used to power a turbine. Generally speaking, the power produced by this turbine is used to run the compressor that pressurises the air fed into the combustion chamber rather than also being used for propulsion. The exhaust gases then pass through a second turbine attached to a shaft, thereby creating the mechanical power used for propulsion.",
